# Analysis-and-Forecasting-of-Crime-Rate-in-San-Francisco-2018-2023:

Abstract: San Francisco, once synonymous with the notorious Alcatraz prison, now
thrives as a tech hub. This project investigates five years of crime reports, spanning from
2018 to the present, across all city neighborhoods, with the objective of predicting a
crime's category based on its time and location. Crime, a perpetual societal issue, has
witnessed varying rates throughout U.S. history. Post-World War II, crime rates surged,
peaking in the 1970s and 1990s. Violent crime saw a nearly fourfold increase from 1960
to its 1991 zenith, while property crime doubled. However, since the 1990s, crime rates
have consistently dwindled. While traditional crime prevention relied on behavioral and
social methods, recent strides in data analysis have ushered in a more quantitative
approach.
In this project, we delve into an extensive dataset, encompassing almost five years of
crime reports spanning San Francisco's diverse neighborhoods. Our aim is to construct
a predictive model capable of discerning a crime's category based on both time and
location. Our approach adheres to a complete data science life cycle: data wrangling,
exploration, feature engineering, data normalization, transformation, and the creation of
training/testing data for model evaluation. The dataset consists of tabular data,
encompassing chronological, geographical, and textual information, sourced from the
SFPD Crime Incident Reporting system. This project promises to deliver invaluable
insights for comprehending and addressing crime patterns in San Francisco.
